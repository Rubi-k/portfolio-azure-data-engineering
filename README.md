End-to-end Azure Data Engineering portfolio showcasing ETL, Data Factory, Synapse, and Delta Lake
🌍 About this Repository

This repository showcases practical Data Engineering projects on Microsoft Azure, designed as a portfolio for recruiters and hiring managers.
It includes end-to-end pipelines, documentation, and architecture diagrams to demonstrate hands-on experience with Azure services.

🚀 Projects
1. ETL with Azure Data Factory & Synapse Serverless

Ingest raw CSV files from Azure Blob Storage (rawdata container).

Transform data using Azure Data Factory (Mapping Data Flows).

Store cleansed data as partitioned Parquet files in the curated container.

Expose data with Synapse serverless external tables and business views.

Deliverables: ADF pipelines (JSON exports), SQL scripts, diagrams, and screenshots.

2. Mini Lakehouse with Databricks & Delta Lake

Ingest data into a Bronze Delta table.

Transform into Silver and Gold layers with Databricks notebooks.

Enable analytics with Databricks SQL and/or Synapse serverless.

Focus on Delta Lake best practices, schema evolution, and partitioning.
