This project demonstrates how to build an **end-to-end data pipeline in Azure**, combining:

- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** â†’ orchestrates data movement and transformation  
- **Azure Blob Storage** â†’ landing zone for raw files and curated zone for transformed data  
- **Azure Synapse Serverless** â†’ exposes curated data for SQL analytics  

The pipeline follows a **raw â†’ curated â†’ analytics** pattern:

1. **Raw** â†’ CSV files (e.g., `customers.csv`) are uploaded into the `rawdata` container  
2. **Curated** â†’ ADF pipelines convert CSVs into **Parquet** format inside the `curated` container  
3. **Analytics** â†’ Curated data is exposed as **external tables** in Synapse for reporting and BI
