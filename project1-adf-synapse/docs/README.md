# Project 1 ‚Äì ETL with Azure Data Factory & Synapse Serverless

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL pipeline using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** and **Azure Synapse Analytics Serverless SQL Pool**, following a lakehouse-style architecture.  

The workflow starts with CSV data stored in Azure Blob Storage (classic), transformed into Parquet files with ADF, and then **manually migrated** to **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** to enable Synapse Serverless external tables (due to Hierarchical Namespace requirements).  

The curated data is queried via external tables in Synapse and prepared for analytics in the gold layer.

## üèó Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](../images/project1_architecture.png)

- **Raw Zone**: CSV files (`customers.csv`, `orders.csv`) in Blob Storage (classic).
- **Curated Zone**: Data transformed to Parquet format using ADF pipelines.
- **Migration Step**: Curated Parquet files were manually copied to ADLS Gen2 using Azure Storage Explorer.
- **Analytics Layer**: Synapse Serverless external tables (curated) and business views (gold).

---

## üìÇ Storage Setup

- Containers created: `rawdata/`, `curated/`, `gold/`
- Source files uploaded to `rawdata/`: `customers.csv`, `orders.csv`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Azure Data Factory (ADF)

### Linked Services
- **Azure Blob Storage (classic)** ‚Äì used for raw and curated zones.
- **Integration Runtime** ‚Äì AutoResolve.

### Datasets
- `ds_customers_raw` ‚Üí CSV (raw).  
- `ds_customers_curated` ‚Üí Parquet (curated).  
- `ds_orders_raw` ‚Üí CSV (raw).  
- `ds_orders_curated` ‚Üí Parquet (curated).  

### Pipeline
- **Copy Activity** to move CSV ‚Üí Parquet.  
- Data types casted and cleaned using Mapping Data Flow.

## üóÑ Azure Synapse Serverless

After manual migration of Parquet files to **ADLS Gen2 (with Hierarchical Namespace)**, Synapse can connect via **Managed Identity**.

### 1. Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE demo_portfolio;
GO
```

### 2. External Data Source
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE eds_adls_synapse
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'abfss://curated@<your-storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net'
);
GO
```

### 3. External File Format
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT eff_parquet
WITH (FORMAT_TYPE = PARQUET);
GO
```

### 4. External Schema & Tables
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA curated;
GO

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE curated.customers (
    CustomerID NVARCHAR(50),
    Name NVARCHAR(100),
    Country NVARCHAR(50)
)
WITH (
    LOCATION = '/customers/',
    DATA_SOURCE = eds_adls_synapse,
    FILE_FORMAT = eff_parquet
);
GO

CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE curated.orders (
    OrderID INT,
    CustomerID NVARCHAR(50),
    OrderDate DATE,
    Amount DECIMAL(10,2)
)
WITH (
    LOCATION = '/orders/',
    DATA_SOURCE = eds_adls_synapse,
    FILE_FORMAT = eff_parquet
);
GO
```

## ‚≠ê Gold Layer ‚Äì Business Views

Business-friendly aggregated views created under schema `gold`:

```sql
-- Total sales per customer
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW gold.sales_per_customer AS
SELECT 
    c.CustomerID,
    c.Name,
    SUM(TRY_CAST(o.Amount AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS TotalSales
FROM curated.customers c
JOIN curated.orders o
  ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.CustomerID, c.Name;
GO

-- Total sales per country
CREATE OR ALTER VIEW gold.sales_per_country AS
SELECT 
    c.Country,
    SUM(TRY_CAST(o.Amount AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS TotalSales
FROM curated.customers c
JOIN curated.orders o
  ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.Country;
GO
```

---

## üîç Validation Queries

Executed in Synapse to ensure consistency:

```sql
-- Inspect curated data
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM curated.customers;
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM curated.orders;

-- Query gold views
SELECT * FROM gold.sales_per_customer ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
SELECT * FROM gold.sales_per_country  ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;

-- Sanity checks: totals must match
SELECT SUM(TRY_CAST(Amount AS DECIMAL(18,2))) AS total_from_orders 
FROM curated.orders;

SELECT SUM(TotalSales) AS total_from_view_customers 
FROM gold.sales_per_customer;

SELECT SUM(TotalSales) AS total_from_view_country  
FROM gold.sales_per_country;
```

## ‚úÖ Lessons Learned

- **Classic Blob Storage limitation**: Synapse Serverless cannot create external tables without **Hierarchical Namespace**.  
- **Workaround**: Curated Parquet files were **manually migrated** to ADLS Gen2 using Azure Storage Explorer.  
- **Schema alignment**: Ensured `CustomerID` types are consistent across tables to allow joins.  
- **Gold layer views**: Provided aggregated analytics for business use cases.  
- This highlights a **real-world architectural evolution**: starting fast with Blob Storage, then migrating to ADLS Gen2 to unlock full analytics capabilities.

---

## üîÆ Next Steps
- (Optional) Connect **Power BI** to Synapse gold views for dashboards.  
- Add more datasets and transformations to expand analytics coverage.  
- Automate deployment with Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/Terraform).
